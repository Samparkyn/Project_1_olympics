Rio Olympics Medal Table (sinatra)

First big project made in Ruby.
A Medal Table for the Rio Olympics with pages to show details about the Nations, Athletes and Events.

Used Ruby and wrote my own database using SQL and Sinatra.
It was great to be able to write, store and display all the data myself in different ways, it gave me a good understanding of how to fetch data in different ways from different tables using SQL.
This was a great project to consolidate what I had learned in Ruby, and allowed me to practice using Restful routes.
I had a lot of fun working with the css for this project.
